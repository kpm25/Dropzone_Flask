process is a global object provided by Node.js that provides information about, and control over,
the current Node.js process. It can be accessed from anywhere without needing to be imported.
It includes methods and properties for things like the process id, the current working directory,
the command line arguments, environment variables, and more. It also provides methods to exit the current
process and to handle signals, like the SIGINT signal which is sent when the user presses Ctrl+C.

you can set up a listener for the SIGINT event, which is emitted when the user presses Ctrl+C

example:

process.on('SIGINT', function() {
    //Do something when the app is interrupted by a user pressing Ctrl+C, example:
    console.log('Received SIGINT. Press Control-D to exit.');

    process.exit();
});

you can think of it as a hook. In Node.js, process.on('SIGINT', function() {...}); is setting up an
event listener for the SIGINT event. This event is triggered when the user interrupts the process
by pressing Ctrl+C. The function provided as the second argument to process.on is the callback
function that will be executed when the SIGINT event occurs. This is similar to how hooks work
in other programming contexts, where a hook is a piece of code that is inserted or passed into
another piece of code at specific points to alter or augment its behavior.


//window terminal PORT process/kill commands

To see which processes are running on port 9876 in Windows, you can use the netstat command with the
 -a, -n, and -o options, and then filter the results with the findstr command. Here is the command:

 netstat -ano | findstr 9876

 This will display a list of all processes that are using port 9876. The last column of the output is the PID (Process ID).
 To kill a process by its PID, you can use the taskkill command with the /F (force) and /PID options.
 Replace yourPID with the actual PID of the process you want to kill:

 taskkill /F /PID yourPID

 Please replace yourPID with the actual PID of the process you want to kill.


 example:

 C:\Users\Admin>netstat -ano | findstr :5000
  TCP    192.168.1.24:5000      0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       21792

C:\Users\Admin> taskkill /F /PID 21792
SUCCESS: The process with PID 21792 has been terminated.
