git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin master

If you've accidentally staged the history.log file, you can unstage it using the git reset command:

git reset history.log

 if the file was tracked by Git before it was added to .gitignore, you need to tell Git to stop tracking it. You can do this with the git rm --cached command:

 git rm --cached history.log

  use git reset history.log to unstage the file if it's currently staged for commit.
  Then, use git rm --cached history.log to stop tracking the file in Git while keeping it in your local file system.

git reset history.log
git rm --cached history.log

The git rm -f command does two things:

It removes the file from your Git repository, meaning it will no longer be tracked by Git.
It also deletes the file from your local file system.
