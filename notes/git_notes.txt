git commit -m "Your commit message"

If you've accidentally staged the history.log file, you can unstage it using the git reset command:

git reset history.log

 if the file was tracked by Git before it was added to .gitignore, you need to tell Git to stop tracking it. You can do this with the git rm --cached command:

 git rm --cached history.log

  use git reset history.log to unstage the file if it's currently staged for commit.
  Then, use git rm --cached history.log to stop tracking the file in Git while keeping it in your local file system.

git reset history.log
git rm --cached history.log

The git rm -f command does two things:

It removes the file from your Git repository, meaning it will no longer be tracked by Git.
It also deletes the file from your local file system.


In a Git commit message, the first line is typically used as the commit title or summary.
This line should be short, concise, and give a clear idea of the changes made in the commit.
The rest of the message, starting from the second line, can provide more detailed information about the changes.
When you use the git commit -m command, you can provide a multi-line commit message by using the -m option multiple times.
Each -m is treated as a separate paragraph. For example:

git commit -m "Commit title" -m "Detailed paragraph about the changes." -m "Additional information or context." -m "And so on."


The .gitignore file applies to its containing directory and all subdirectories. The patterns in the .gitignore file match
against the paths relative to its location. For example, a .gitignore file located in the root directory of your project will
apply to the entire project. If you place a .gitignore file in a subdirectory, it will only apply to that directory and its
subdirectories.
